# django-restframework-api
A small RESTful API based on Django Restframework https://www.django-rest-framework.org/ <p>

This is just a small training/example project, how to setup Django Restframework APIs. <br>
In this API I took "ropes" as an app, because as a small private project, I'm crafting dog accessories like leashes or collars. <br>
Therefor, I got quite a lot of ropes (climbing ropes or paracord) at home and as an exercise I would like to sort them in a REST API :) <br>
